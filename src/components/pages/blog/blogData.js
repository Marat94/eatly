           roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
           years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
           College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
           consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
           the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.`

    text: ` Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
            Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
            45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
            the Renaissance.`
